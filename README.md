# Emotions detection by using deep learning techniques

# Summary
The objective of this TFG is to carry out a study of how Deep Learning could be applied to detect 
emotions in human faces
To do this, first of all the performance of different architectures of convolutional neural networks that already 
exist for our specific problem will be evaluated to subsequently optimize them, and based on the 
conclusions obtained, design our own architecture more adapted to the problem.

For the development of the project, as we will expand on later, we will use the FER2013 facial 
expression recognition database, whose state of the art is around 76.82% accuracy using an ensemble of 
several neural networks.
In this project, an optimization of the Den-seNet201 architecture is proposed as a final model that 
obtains an accuracy of 69.35%. Furthermore, as we will see during the development of the project, we will 
explore the optimization of our model to improve other metrics more appropriate for the problem than the 
accuracy itself.
